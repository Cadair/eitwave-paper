\subsection{Detections with SDO/AIA image data}

To illustrate the application of the AWARE algorithm to real solar imaging data, we examine a selection of recent events observed by SDO/AIA. These are the flares of 2011 February 13, 2011 February 15, 2011 February 16, and 2011 October 1. These flares serve as a convenient starting point for the search algorithm, given that EUV waves are considered to be triggered phenomenon. 

Figure \ref{results_figure} shows both the result of AWARE image processing (top panels), and wave characterization (bottom panels) steps.
