\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

We have demonstrated the core functionality of AWARE, a new algorithm for the detection and characterization of EUV waves in the solar corona. As shown in Section \ref{sec:results}, AWARE performs effectively, providing confirmed detections of wave both for simulated wave data with known parameters, and also for a number of real EUV wave events (see Figure \ref{results_figure}). In both cases, mimimal human input was required in order to acheive the presented results. 

The next steps in the development are already underway (see Section \ref{sec:future}), including the construction of a consistent AWARE data product for disemmination to the solar community. This product will include metadata on any detected EUV waves, as well as image masks of the detected events. Additional steps will include further integration with online heliophysics tools, such as the HEK and VSO services.
