\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}

Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves are large-scale propagating
disturbances observed in the solar corona, frequently associated with
coronal mass ejections and flares.  Since their discovery
\citep{1997SoPh..175..571M, 1998GeoRL..25.2465T, 1999ApJ...517L.151T}
over two hundred papers discussing their properties, causes and
physics have been published.  However, their fundamental nature is
still not understood. In general, studies of this phenomenon can be
assigned to at least one of these broad, non-exclusive categories: the
physical nature and appearance of EUV waves, investigation of
correlated phenomena, such as CMEs, flares, dimmings, and filament
activity, probing the origin or driver of EUV waves, understanding the
interaction with and impact on existing coronal features.

In each of these categories, there have been major breakthroughs in
the last several years, primarily due to the availability of
high-cadence, multi-wavelength, multi-viewpoint observations from SDO,
STEREO, Hinode, and other sources (for comprehensive reviews of recent
results see \cite{2011SSRv..158..365G}; \cite{2011JASTP..73.1096Z};
\cite{2011A&A...532A.151W}, \cite{2012SoPh..281..187P}).  Careful
analysis has yielded a much improved understanding of the EUV wave
phenomenon (e.g., Fig. 1), but it is clear that many outstanding
questions remain.

At a fundamental level, the physical nature of EUV waves is not
completely understood. Some studies present evidence supporting a
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave interpretation
\citep{1998GeoRL..25.2465T, 1999ApJ...517L.151T,2000ApJ...543L..89W,
  2001JGR...10625089W, 2002ApJ...574..440O, 2010ApJ...713.1008S},
others argue for what \cite{2012SoPh..281..187P} call a “pseudo-wave”
due to either the evolving manifestations of a CME
\citep{1999SoPh..190..107D, 2000ApJ...545..512D, 2008SoPh..247..123D,
  2011ApJ...738..167S} or transient localized brightenings
\citep{2007AN....328..760A, 2007ApJ...656L.101A,}.  Some authors have
found evidence indicating that the complex brightenings associated
with EUV waves can be due to a combination of both MHD waves and
pseudo-waves \citep{2002ApJ...572L..99C, 2005ApJ...622.1202C,
  2004A&A...427..705Z, 2009ApJ...705..587C}.  It is clear from the
literature that the physical conditions that lead to the broad range
of observed wave propagation speeds \citep{2011A&A...532A.151W} and
amplitudes are poorly understood.

EUV waves are also clearly correlated with several other dynamic
phenomena, though there are still efforts underway to distinguish
correlative vs. causal relationships.  These studies are extremely
important, as they provide clear clues as to the origin and physical
nature of the waves.  For example, \cite{2002ApJ...569.1009B}
demonstrated that CMEs show a much greater association to EUV waves
than do flares, while \cite{2006ApJ...641L.153} found that only
eruptive flares were associated with EUV waves.  Other investigations,
such as \cite{2000SoPh..193..161T} and \cite{2004A&A...427..705Z} and
\cite{2010ApJ...709..369P} have also indicated that the development of
coronal dimmings may be closely linked to the development of EUV
waves.

The path of EUV waves have been observed to be modified by nearly all
major coronal features, including active regions (Wang 2000),
filaments (Liu et al. 2012), coronal holes (e.g., Gopalswamy et
al. 2009), streamers (e.g., Kwon et al. 2013), and with varying
degrees of transmission, refraction, reflection and absorption reveal
details about the wave interaction with these features. However, the
impulsive excitation, and the range of interactions between the EUV
waves and other coronal structures are still unknown.

EUV waves can be used to infer properties of the coronal medium that
are otherwise hard to measure, i.e., they may be used as tools to
perform coronal seismology \citep{1970PASJ...22..341U}.  If one
assumes that an EUV wave propagates as a fast MHD wave mode (see
\cite{2011SSRv..158..365G}, for a review of current interpretations of
EUV waves), and the wave propagation speed, coronal density and
temperature can all be estimated, then the coronal magnetic field
strength can be derived \cite{2005LRSP....2....3N}.  This value can
also be used to test the accuracy of magnetic field extrapolation
codes \citep{2008ApJ...675.1637S} and other indirect measurements of
the coronal magnetic field strength \citep{2007Sci...317.1192T}.

Advances in solar instrumentation have allowed substantial progress to
be made in the study of EUV waves. Data from STEREO/EUVI provided a
significant improvement over prior EUV wave observations (e.g., Long
et al. 2008, Veronig, Temmer, & Vršnak 2008).  With the launch of SDO,
highly detailed, multi-wavelength observations of EUV waves are
possible (e.g. Fig. 2), illuminating the complex structure and
interactions of these waves (e.g., Liu et al. 2012). With these new
data, studies of individual wave events (e.g., Long, DeLuca &
Gallagher 2011) have augmented earlier kinematic studies (Wills-Davey
& Thompson, 1999; Wang, 2000), improving the description of the
initiation and subsequent deceleration of EUV waves.

However, to answer all of the fundamental questions regarding the
physical nature of EUV waves, studying individual wave events or small
samples is insufficient. To make the next breakthrough in
understanding this phenomenon requires large-scale statistical studies
with events robustly categorized by their properties.  Hence, we
propose to develop and implement AWARE, a new automated EUV wave
detection and characterization procedure applied to EUV image
data. Such a fully automated procedure is essential in order to unlock
the full potential of the large HSO EUV full disk image dataset, and
will enable the characterization of EUV waves in large numbers for the
first time. AWARE will not only detect and characterize EUV waves in
near real-time, but will also provide data products and event
summaries available through the Solar Data Analysis Center.  The
output of AWARE will substantially enhance the scientific community’s
capabilities in EUV wave research, particularly in the following
areas: 

robustly determining whether different classes of EUV waves,
with different physical characteristics, are supported by
observations.  

studying the relationship between EUV waves and
associated phenomena, such as coronal dimmings and secondary
eruptions.  

using EUV waves to perform coronal seismology and better
understand the properties of the solar corona.  

the strength of
correlations between various wave properties - such as velocity and
amplitude - with the properties of the energetic events that produce
these waves, for example CME eruption speed and flare magnitude.
