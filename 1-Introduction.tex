\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}

Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves are large-scale propagating
disturbances observed in the solar corona, frequently associated with
coronal mass ejections and flares.  Since their discovery \citep
{1997SoPh..175..571M, 1998GeoRL..25.2465T, 1999ApJ...517L.151T} over
two hundred papers discussing their properties, causes and physics
have been published.  However, their fundamental nature is still not
understood. In general, studies of this phenomenon can be assigned to
at least one of these broad, non-exclusive categories: the physical
nature and appearance of EUV waves, investigation of correlated
phenomena, such as CMEs, flares, dimmings, and filament activity,
probing the origin or driver of EUV waves, understanding the
interaction with and impact on existing coronal features.

In each of these categories, there have been major breakthroughs in
the last several years, primarily due to the availability of
high-cadence, multi-wavelength, multi-viewpoint observations from SDO,
STEREO, Hinode, and other sources (for comprehensive reviews of recent
results see \cite{2011SSRv..158..365G}; \cite{2011JASTP..73.1096Z};
\cite{2011A&A...532A.151W}, \cite{2012SoPh..281..187P}).  Careful
analysis has yielded a much improved understanding of the EUV wave
phenomenon (e.g., Fig. 1), but it is clear that many outstanding
questions remain.

At a fundamental level, the physical nature of EUV waves is not
completely understood. Some studies present evidence supporting a
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave interpretation
\citep{1998GeoRL..25.2465T, 1999ApJ...517L.151T,2000ApJ...543L..89W,
  2001JGR...10625089W, 2002ApJ...574..440O, 2010ApJ...713.1008S},
others argue for what \cite{2012SoPh..281..187P} call a “pseudo-wave”
due to either the evolving manifestations of a CME
\citep{1999SoPh..190..107D, 2000ApJ...545..512D, 2008SoPh..247..123D,
  2011ApJ...738..167S} or transient localized brightenings
\citep{2007AN....328..760A, 2007ApJ...656L.101A,}.  Some authors have
found evidence indicating that the complex brightenings associated
with EUV waves can be due to a combination of both MHD waves and
pseudo-waves (Chen et al., 2002; Chen, Fang, and Shibata, 2005; Zhukov
and Auchère, 2004; Cohen et al., 2009).  It is clear from the
literature that the physical conditions that lead to the broad range
of observed wave propagation speeds \citep{2011A&A...532A.151W} and
amplitudes are poorly understood.

EUV waves are also clearly correlated with several other dynamic
phenomena, though there are still efforts underway to distinguish
correlative vs. causal relationships.  These studies are extremely
important, as they provide clear clues as to the origin and physical
nature of the waves.  For example, Biesecker et al. (2002)
demonstrated that CMEs show a much greater association to EUV waves
than do flares, while Chen (2006) found that only eruptive flares were
associated with EUV waves.  Other investigations, such as Thompson et
al. (2000), Zhukov & Auchère (2004) and Podladchikova et al. (2010)
have also indicated that the development of coronal dimmings may be
closely linked to the development of EUV waves.
