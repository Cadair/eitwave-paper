Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves are large-scale propagating
disturbances observed in the solar corona, frequently associated with
coronal mass ejections and flares. Since their discovery over two
hundred papers discussing their properties, causes and physics have
been published. However, their fundamental nature and the physics of
their interactions with other solar phenomena are still not
understood. To further the understanding of EUV waves, and their
relation to other solar phenomena, we have constructed the Automated
Wave Analysis and REduction (AWARE) algorithm for the detection of EUV
waves over the full Sun. The AWARE algorithm is based on a novel image
processing approach to isolating the bright wavefront of the EUV as it
propagates across the corona.  AWARE detects the presence of a
wavefront, and measures the distance, velocity and acceleration of
that wavefront across the Sun.  The algorithm is applied to
simulations of EUV wave propagation and to observed data.  Suggestions
are also give for further refinements to the basic algorithm presented
here.
